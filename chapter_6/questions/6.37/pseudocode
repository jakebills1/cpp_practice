write an iterative function to determine the nth fibonacci number
  1: use type int
  2: use type double

method:
need to loop n times, storing the results of n - 1 loop, and n - 2 loop after the first and second repetition.
  store two ints int1 and int2, initialize first to 0 and second to 1
  for loop n times:
    if first time:
      print first int(0)
    if second time
      print second int(1)
    else
      print sum of two ints
      int1 = n 
      int2 = int1
alternate:
  fibonacci is a function with 1/2 static local variables, which will be used to keep track of previous values in the fibonacci sequence
    for n times
      call fibonacci(i)
        if this is the first call to fibonacci, return 0
