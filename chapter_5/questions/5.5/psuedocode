write a program that takes an integer as input, which will be the number of integers to be summed

method:
  main should call a function, sum, which takes an argument ( int n ) which will be the number of inputs it will take, before summing them
  sum: 
    initialize a variable times, set it equal to n, if n is positive
    initialize a variable, sum, to 0
    for times:
      ask user for input
      add input to sum
    return sum
