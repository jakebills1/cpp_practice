- in c++, arrays are consecutive memory locations of the same type.
  - declared like `type arrayName[size]`
  - initializing arrays
    - the values in static arrays are initialized to 0, they are not in automatic variables
  - passing arrays to function:
    - in cpp, arrays are pass-by-reference. one typically passes the array size at the same time. just pass the array name into the function
      - according to the principle of least privilege, outside functions should not modify arrays in main. declaring an array as const prevents this, as it will result in a compliation error
    - individual array elements are pass by value
- searching
  - linear:
    - good for small arrays or unsorted arrays
- sorting
  - insertion
    - at the first element, look at the next element and insert it before the first one, if it is smaller
- vectors
  - more fully featured version of array, that protects against out of bounds errors and such
  - by default, all values in a vector are initialized to 0, when declared
  - vectors have a member function, size, which returns the number of elements in the vector as a size_t
    - as such, loop control variables should be a size_t as well, since comparing an int and a size_t could cause compilation issues
  - vectors can be compared using equality operators
  - one vector can be initialized with the contents of another
  - vectors have amember function, at, which accesses an element at the given index. if the index is out-of-range, at will throw an error
- exceptions
  - in a try-catch block, if an error is thrown in the try block, it terminates and the catch block begins executing
    - the catch block derclares a type of error(out of range)and an exception parameter(ex)
      - the exception parameter has a member function, what, which retrieves and displays the error message in the exception object
