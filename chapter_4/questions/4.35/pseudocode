design an application to read in a 4 digit integer and encrypt it by: 
  replace each digit with the results of adding 7 to the digit, and getting it's remainder after dividing by 10
  swap the first and third digits, and second and fourth digits. 
make this application able to decrypt numbers encrypted via this scheme

method
  write a class with the following member functions: encrypt, decrypt
    encrypt:
      takes a four digit number, if the digit is positive, and four digits, sets in equal to plaintext
      initialize four variables: dig1, dig2, dig3, dig4
      using the mod 10, divide by ten method to modify the plaintext, store each successive (digit + 7) % 10
      print the following: dig3, dig4, dig1, dig2
    decrypt:
      takes a four digit number, ciphertext
      initialize 4 variables, dig1,,dig4
      dig2 = ciphertext mod 10
      ciphertext = ciphertext / 10
      dig1 = ciphertext mod 10
      ciphertext = ciphertext / 10
      dig4 = ciphertext mod 10
      ciphertext = ciphertext / 10
      dig3 = ciphertext
      for each successive dig
        dig = (dig - 7 + 10) % 10
      print dig1, dig2, dig3, dig4
