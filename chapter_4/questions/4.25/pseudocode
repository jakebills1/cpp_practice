write a function that takes as input the size, as an int, of one side of a square. Then print a hollow square made up of asterisks.

method
  initialive int size
  initialise int counter to 1
  initialive string ast = "*"
  initialive string blank = " "
  ask user for input, validate input to be an int between 1 and 20
  store input in size
  start a loop that will run size times. this will print rows.
    on the first run, when counter = 1, print size numbers of asterisks using a loop that runs size times
    on runs that are not equal to 1 or size, print an asterisk, size - 2 number of blanks, then an asterisk\
    on the run where counter = size, print size numbers of asterisks
